# Stats

This idiot once had the idea it would be good to analyze statistics in more detail in order to measure the effect of parameter changes in order to properly tune the setup as well as creating the ability to evaluate functionality like i.e. PrioQ.

With limited knowlegde, help from my best friend Google, the attitude "steal with pride" and some perseverance this is what I cooked up.

Surely it can be done more efficient and some will surely have a good laugh when looking this. 

Anyway/anyhow......like me.....steal with pride.....(ab)use it the way you see fit or just ignore it all together.
Use it at you own risk, because bare in mind this was all done by an idiot!
